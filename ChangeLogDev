*0.0.7b (gtransfer)
*0.0.4b (dparam)
*0.0.4c (dpath)

all:
Enhanced builtin support for configuration files. The scripts now search for the
configuration files in three different locations:
- "/opt/gtransfer/etc/" (default for system install)
- "/etc/opt/gtransfer/"
- "$HOME/.gtransfer/" (default for user install)

*0.0.7c (gtransfer)
*0.0.4c (dparam)
*0.0.4d (dpath)

all:
Removed describing content about the configuration file contents from the
scripts. On a specific version of bash (3.1.17(1)) this didn't work and created
an error message. The following construct was used before:
"
VARIABLE=$( cat <<EOF
[...]
EOF
)
"

Improved infile documentation of "gtransfer.conf". Improved installation 
documentation in INSTALL and "install.sh" script. The gtransfer tarball should
now conform to the FHS v2.3 standard.

*0.0.5 (dpath)
Dpath now supports listing dpaths for both system and user dirs. Listing of
sources and destinations now also includes data from system dpaths. Adapted help
output and manpage.

*0.0.5 (dparam)
Dparam now supports listing dparams for both system and user dirs. Adapted help
output and manpage.

Minor changes in man pages and modulefile.

*0.0.5a (dpath)
Corrected a wrong function call. The function name was still using the old
nomenclature.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d:
Introduced own version number for gtransfer distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by gtransfer itself, as updates to dpath and
dparam would not justify a new version number for gtransfer.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d-dev01

bash completion file:
Renamed to "gtransfer.sh", as for example SLES10 only uses files in "/etc/
bash_completiond.d" if they have ".sh" as suffix. Now the completion also
completes remote paths on FTP (ftp://) servers (in addition to (gsiftp://).
A completion for "http://" or "https://" is not possible, as guc doesn't
support globbing for this type of server (or URL scheme in guc speak).

*0.0.7c-dev01 (gtransfer):
gtransfer now supports and by default uses the reliability options of guc. This
means that gtransfer survives (data channel) server faults. By default gt 
instructs guc to do a maximum of one retry for each file that is transferred. If
guc fails due to a second transfer error for the same file or generally due to
an unspecified error, gt will retry the transfer step three times before giving
up. Both max retry numbers are configurable ("--guc-max-retries" and 
"--gt-max-retries"). If gt fails due to transfer errors, it should be sufficient
to just repeat the very same command to finish/continue the broken transfer. gt
stores sort of state information in the dir one issues the gt command from.

gt now also makes use of a new tgftp option (--force-log-overwrite). By default
tgftp - a benchmarking, test and transfer tool - refuses to overwrite transfer 
logfiles in order to avoid data loss by chance. As gt uses tgftp to transfer
files, it is sometimes very cumbersome, that one needs to delete the tgftp
logfiles before retrying a transfer. To initially solve this, the option "-a"
was introduced, which removes all logfiles after gt has finished. But the better
idea is to force tgftp to overwrite its transfer logfiles, because then one
always has at least the logs of the last transfer. The "--force-log-overwrite"
option was introduced with tgftp v0.4.1, hence gt now depends on tgftp v0.4.1.

gtransfer distribution 0.0.7d-dev02

*0.0.7c-dev02 (gtransfer):
Enabled reconfigurable paths to conf files (details below). Disabled filename
globbing where not needed. Enable plugins for gt (check script for details;
search for "#  load plugins"). Removed uberftp (hard) dependency. If uberftp is
available, temp dirs on transit sites are removed after the corresponding
transfer, if not, they're left there.

*0.0.5a-dev01 (dpath):
Enabled reconfigurable paths to conf files (details below).

*0.0.5-dev01 (dparam):
Enabled reconfigurable paths to conf files (details below).

install.sh:
Paths to configuration files for gt, dpath and dparam are now reconfigured in
the scripts during installation. If an install goes to e.g.
"/opt/provider/gtransfer", gt, dpath and dparam will also look into
"/opt/provider/gtransfer/etc" for their configuration files.

2012-02-20  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

*0.0.5a-dev01a (dpath):
Corrected wrong conffile name for reconfiguration by installer script.

*0.0.5-dev01a (dparam):
Corrected wrong conffile name for reconfiguration by installer script.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d_dev02a:

Added PDF versions of the manual pages to the repo.

*0.0.7c-dev02a (gtransfer)
Corrected a bug in the getPathFromURL() function that showed wrong behaviour for
URLs with files in the root directory ("/"). Example:

gsiftp://host.domain:2811/file.txt

This was parsed as follows:

protocol spec: gsiftp://
URL without path: gsiftp://host.domain:2811
path: "" (!) (=> should be "/")
file: file.txt

Thanks to Giacomo Mariani (CINECA) for detecting this bug.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d-dev03:

*0.0.7c-dev03 (gtransfer)
Added workaround for guc limitation. guc creates dirs with group and world r-x
permissions set. Because of this, temp dirs on transit sites were readable by
others than the owner during a transfer from source to transit site, transit
site to transit site and transit site to destination site.
The workaround now uses a tgftp pre-command to create the dir and then make it
only accessible by the owner (chmod 0700). This is done with two calls to
uberftp in the cases described above.

!IMPORTANT!
Additionally internal logic changes were introduced, that require a change in
the gtransfer configuration file. "verboseExec" is now activated when set to "1"
instead of "0". PLEASE CHANGE THIS IN YOUR CONF FILES!
