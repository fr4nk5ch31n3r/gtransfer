*0.0.7b (gtransfer)
*0.0.4b (dparam)
*0.0.4c (dpath)

all:
Enhanced builtin support for configuration files. The scripts now search for the
configuration files in three different locations:
- "/opt/gtransfer/etc/" (default for system install)
- "/etc/opt/gtransfer/"
- "$HOME/.gtransfer/" (default for user install)

*0.0.7c (gtransfer)
*0.0.4c (dparam)
*0.0.4d (dpath)

all:
Removed describing content about the configuration file contents from the
scripts. On a specific version of bash (3.1.17(1)) this didn't work and created
an error message. The following construct was used before:
"
VARIABLE=$( cat <<EOF
[...]
EOF
)
"

Improved infile documentation of "gtransfer.conf". Improved installation 
documentation in INSTALL and "install.sh" script. The gtransfer tarball should
now conform to the FHS v2.3 standard.

*0.0.5 (dpath)
Dpath now supports listing dpaths for both system and user dirs. Listing of
sources and destinations now also includes data from system dpaths. Adapted help
output and manpage.

*0.0.5 (dparam)
Dparam now supports listing dparams for both system and user dirs. Adapted help
output and manpage.

*0.0.5a (dpath)
Corrected a wrong function call. The function name was still using the old
nomenclature.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d:
Introduced own version number for gtransfer distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by gtransfer itself, as updates to dpath and
dparam would not justify a new version number for gtransfer.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7e:

Added PDF versions of the manual pages to the repo.

*0.0.7d (gtransfer)
Corrected a bug in the getPathFromURL() function that showed wrong behaviour for
URLs with files in the root directory ("/"). Example:

gsiftp://host.domain:2811/file.txt

This was parsed as follows:

protocol spec: gsiftp://
URL without path: gsiftp://host.domain:2811
path: "" (!) (=> should be "/")
file: file.txt

Thanks to Giacomo Mariani (CINECA) for detecting this bug.
