gtransfer dist v0.1.2:

*0.1.2 (gtransfer):
gt v0.1.1 always performed recursive transfers. This is now corrected and per
default gt now performs non-recursive transfers again. Fixes #5. Also defused a
guc call. Fixes #4.

*(install.sh):
The installer now also install the exemplary chunkConfig file. Fixes #6.

gtransfer dist 0.1.1:

*0.1.1 (gtransfer):
The chunk creation in the auto-optimization of gtransfer v0.1.0 did not
correctly handle cases where no files of specific file size classes existed in
the list of files to transfer. This is now corrected. Fixes #1. Also added
functionality to remove the directory for gt temp files after a successful
transfer.

*0.1.1 (dpath):
dpath now correctly ignores empty dpath directories. Fixes #2.

*0.2.0 (dparam):
Updated dparam list logic to dpath counterpart.

gtransfer dist 0.1.0:

*0.1.0 (gtransfer):
Merged dev version into master version of gtransfer. This added the following
functionality:
- Support for bash libraries, specific functionality is now contained in
  libraries.
- Support for list transfers.
- Support for configurable auto-optimization depending on the file size.
- Support for reliabilty (incl. configurable number of retries).
- Support for interruptible and continuable transfers.
- Temporary files created during a transfer are now located below
  "$HOME/.gtransfer/tmp/<SHA1_HASH_OF_COMMAND_LINE>/".
  
*0.1.0 (dpath):
Now supports dpath retrieval via globus-url-copy which allows to use "http://",
"https://", "gsiftp://" and "file://" URLs. Also integrated a reindexing
functionality to allow to use already existing dpaths and updating the indices
with sources and destinations from those dpaths.

*0.1.0 (dparam):
Now also supports dpath retrieval via globus-url-copy which allows to use
"http://", "https://", "gsiftp://" and "file://" URLs.

gtransfer dist 0.0.10a:

*0.0.10a (gtransfer):
Corrected a call to the usageMsg() function that still used the old function
name.

2012-11-14  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

gtransfer dist 0.0.10:

*0.0.10 (gtransfer):
The connection check functionality (done prior to a transfer) can now be
deactivated from the config file. In addition the timeout used for the
connection check is now also configurable from the config file. The v0.0.10
connection check functionality behaves like in pre-v0.0.10 versions when a
pre-v0.0.10 config file is used.

*0.0.6 (dpath):
dpath now supports to create all possible dpaths between host addresses given
in a file (BATCH CREATE mode). It now can also use a specific dpath template in
CREATE and BATCH CREATE mode. In addition the list sources/destinations
functionality now can also use index files for sources (sources.index) and
destinations (destinations.index). This decreases response time of the remote
host completion of gtransfer considerably when many dpaths are available. The
index files are automatically created and updated during dpath creation.

(installer):
The installer script was reworked and now does not create links with absolute
paths for a system install. In addition the INSTALL document was renamed and
reformatted to Markdown syntax.

gtransfer dist v0.0.9c:

Renamed modulefiles to generic names. Version strings inside of the modulefiles
are now configurable by the tarball build script (not part of the repo!). Names
of modulefiles are now also automatically renamed to the current dist version
when building tarballs.

Installer script adapted (included new name for README.md and bash completion
file).

Some rework on manual pages (consistency, config file search order, etc.).

gtransfer dist v0.0.9b:

*0.0.9b (gtransfer):
Hotfix for a serious bug. Due to an unmodified call to an internal function,
which got a new interface in v0.0.8, v0.0.8 to v0.0.9a versions remove the
source directory after transferring the data (in a single step transfer) to the
destination directory if no dpath exists for the current source destination
combination. This is now fixed.

gtransfer dist v0.0.9a:

*0.0.9a (gtransfer), 0.0.5b (dpath), 0.0.5a (dparam)
Added "/etc/gtransfer" search path for gtransfer configuration files to support
native OS packages. Removed non-standard "/opt/gtransfer/etc" search path
(although the FHS 2.3 is not fully clear on this). Adapted installer script and
tools to automatically add a config file search path for the gtransfer
installation dir structure. Updated man pages. Filename globbing is deactivated
inside of gtransfer.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.9:

*0.0.9 (gtransfer)
Added a workaround for a uberftp "anomaly". Two or more subsequent calls to
uberftp don't work if the time frame in between is too short. The second call to
uberftp then fails and emits "Failed to connect to <IP_ADDRESS> port
<PORT_NUMBER>: Cannot assign requested address". The current workaround should
work for multi-step transfers that are not too short. If they're too short, the
post-command that removes the transit directory might be executed too early
after the pre-command that creates the transit directory and chmods it to 0700
was executed.

2012-05-11  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

gtransfer distribution v0.0.8:

*0.0.8 (gtransfer)
Added workaround for guc limitation. guc creates dirs with group and world r-x
permissions set. Because of this, temp dirs on transit sites were readable by
others than the owner during a transfer from source to transit site, transit
site to transit site and transit site to destination site.
The workaround now uses a tgftp pre-command to create the dir and then make it
only accessible by the owner (chmod 0700). This is done with two calls to
uberftp in the cases described above.

!IMPORTANT!
Additionally internal logic changes were introduced, that require a change in
the gtransfer configuration file. "verboseExec" is now activated when set to "1"
instead of "0". PLEASE CHANGE THIS IN YOUR CONF FILES!

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7e:

Added PDF versions of the manual pages to the repo.

*0.0.7d (gtransfer)
Corrected a bug in the getPathFromURL() function that showed wrong behaviour for
URLs with files in the root directory ("/"). Example:

gsiftp://host.domain:2811/file.txt

This was parsed as follows:

protocol spec: gsiftp://
URL without path: gsiftp://host.domain:2811
path: "" (!) (=> should be "/")
file: file.txt

Thanks to Giacomo Mariani (CINECA) for detecting this bug.

2012-02-03 Frank Scheiner <frank.scheiner@web.de>

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d:
Introduced own version number for gtransfer distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by gtransfer itself, as updates to dpath and
dparam would not justify a new version number for gtransfer.

2012-01-19  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

*0.0.5a (dpath)
Corrected a wrong function call. The function name was still using the old
nomenclature.

2012-01-09  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

Minor changes in man pages and modulefile.

2011-12-18  Frank Scheiner <frank.scheiner@web.de>

*0.0.7c (gtransfer)
*0.0.4c (dparam)
*0.0.4d (dpath)

all:
Removed describing content about the configuration file contents from the
scripts. On a specific version of bash (3.1.17(1)) this didn't work and created
an error message. The following construct was used before:
"
VARIABLE=$( cat <<EOF
[...]
EOF
)
"

Improved infile documentation of "gtransfer.conf". Improved installation 
documentation in INSTALL and "install.sh" script. The gtransfer tarball should
now conform to the FHS v2.3 standard.

*0.0.5 (dpath)
Dpath now supports listing dpaths for both system and user dirs. Listing of
sources and destinations now also includes data from system dpaths. Adapted help
output and manpage.

*0.0.5 (dparam)
Dparam now supports listing dparams for both system and user dirs. Adapted help
output and manpage.

2011-12-17  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

*0.0.7b (gtransfer)
*0.0.4b (dparam)
*0.0.4c (dpath)

all:
Enhanced builtin support for configuration files. The scripts now search for the
configuration files in three different locations:
- "/opt/gtransfer/etc/" (default for system install)
- "/etc/opt/gtransfer/"
- "$HOME/.gtransfer/" (default for user install)
