*0.0.7b (gtransfer)
*0.0.4b (dparam)
*0.0.4c (dpath)

all:
Enhanced builtin support for configuration files. The scripts now search for the
configuration files in three different locations:
- "/opt/gtransfer/etc/" (default for system install)
- "/etc/opt/gtransfer/"
- "$HOME/.gtransfer/" (default for user install)

*0.0.7c (gtransfer)
*0.0.4c (dparam)
*0.0.4d (dpath)

all:
Removed describing content about the configuration file contents from the
scripts. On a specific version of bash (3.1.17(1)) this didn't work and created
an error message. The following construct was used before:
"
VARIABLE=$( cat <<EOF
[...]
EOF
)
"

Improved infile documentation of "gtransfer.conf". Improved installation 
documentation in INSTALL and "install.sh" script. The gtransfer tarball should
now conform to the FHS v2.3 standard.

*0.0.5 (dpath)
Dpath now supports listing dpaths for both system and user dirs. Listing of
sources and destinations now also includes data from system dpaths. Adapted help
output and manpage.

*0.0.5 (dparam)
Dparam now supports listing dparams for both system and user dirs. Adapted help
output and manpage.

Minor changes in man pages and modulefile.

*0.0.5a (dpath)
Corrected a wrong function call. The function name was still using the old
nomenclature.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7d:
Introduced own version number for gtransfer distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by gtransfer itself, as updates to dpath and
dparam would not justify a new version number for gtransfer.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.7e:

Added PDF versions of the manual pages to the repo.

*0.0.7d (gtransfer)
Corrected a bug in the getPathFromURL() function that showed wrong behaviour for
URLs with files in the root directory ("/"). Example:

gsiftp://host.domain:2811/file.txt

This was parsed as follows:

protocol spec: gsiftp://
URL without path: gsiftp://host.domain:2811
path: "" (!) (=> should be "/")
file: file.txt

Thanks to Giacomo Mariani (CINECA) for detecting this bug.

gtransfer distribution v0.0.8:

*0.0.8 (gtransfer)
Added workaround for guc limitation. guc creates dirs with group and world r-x
permissions set. Because of this, temp dirs on transit sites were readable by
others than the owner during a transfer from source to transit site, transit
site to transit site and transit site to destination site.
The workaround now uses a tgftp pre-command to create the dir and then make it
only accessible by the owner (chmod 0700). This is done with two calls to
uberftp in the cases described above.

!IMPORTANT!
Additionally internal logic changes were introduced, that require a change in
the gtransfer configuration file. "verboseExec" is now activated when set to "1"
instead of "0". PLEASE CHANGE THIS IN YOUR CONF FILES!

gtransfer distribution v0.0.9:

*0.0.9 (gtransfer)
Added a workaround for a uberftp "anomaly". Two or more subsequent calls to
uberftp don't work if the time frame in between is too short. The second call to
uberftp then fails and emits "Failed to connect to <IP_ADDRESS> port
<PORT_NUMBER>: Cannot assign requested address". The current workaround should
work for multi-step transfers that are not too short. If they're too short, the
post-command that removes the transit directory might be executed too early
after the pre-command that creates the transit directory and chmods it to 0700
was executed.

gtransfer dist v0.0.9a:

*0.0.9a (gtransfer), 0.0.5b (dpath), 0.0.5a (dparam)
Added "/etc/gtransfer" search path for gtransfer configuration files to support
native OS packages. Removed non-standard "/opt/gtransfer/etc" search path
(although the FHS 2.3 is not fully clear on this). Adapted installer script and
tools to automatically add a config file search path for the gtransfer
installation dir structure. Updated man pages. Filename globbing is deactivated
inside of gtransfer.

gtransfer dist v0.0.9b:

*0.0.9b (gtransfer):
Hotfix for a serious bug. Due to an unmodified call to an internal function,
which got a new interface in v0.0.8, v0.0.8 to v0.0.9a versions remove the
source directory after transferring the data (in a single step transfer) to the
destination directory if no dpath exists for the current source destination
combination. This is now fixed.
