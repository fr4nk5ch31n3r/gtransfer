.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] is a wrapper script for the \f[B]tgftp(1)\f[]
tool and provides an advanced command line interface for performing
GridFTP data transfers.
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] has the following features:
.SS Multi-step data transfers
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] can transfer files along predefined paths by
using transit sites and can therefore bridge different network
domains.
See \f[B]dpath(5)\f[] for more details.
.SS Optimized data transfer performance
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] supports usage of pre-optimized data transfer
parameters for specific connections.
See dparam(5) for more details.
In addition \f[B]gtransfer\f[] can also automatically optimize a
data transfer depending on the size of the files.
.SS Data transfer interruption and continuation
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] supports interruption and continuation of
transfers.
You can interrupt a transfer by hitting \f[B]CTRL+C\f[].
To continue an interrupted transfer simply issue the very same
command, \f[B]gtransfer\f[] will then continue the transfer where
it was interrupted.
The same procedure works for a failed transfer.
.SS Data transfer reliability
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] supports automatic retries of failed transfer
steps.
The number of retries is configurable.
.SS Bash completion
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] makes use of bash completion to ease usage.
This supports completion of options and URLs.
URL completion also expands (remote) paths.
Just hit the \f[B]TAB\f[] key to see what's possible.
.SS Host aliases
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] can use host aliases as alternatives to host
addresses.
E.g.
a user can use \[lq]myGridFTP:\[rq] and
\[lq]gsiftp://host1.domain.tld:2811\[rq] synonymically.
.SS Persistent identifiers (PIDs)
.PP
\f[B]gtransfer\f[] can use persistent identifiers (PIDs) as used by
EUDAT and provided by EPIC as source of a data transfer.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options are as follows:
.SS \f[B][-s, --source \f[I]sourceUrl\f[]]\f[]
.PP
Set the source URL for the transfer.
.PP
Possible URL examples:
.IP \[bu] 2
{[gsi]ftp|http[s]}://FQDN[:PORT]/path/to/file
.IP \[bu] 2
[file://]/path/to/file
.PP
\[lq]FQDN\[rq] is the fully qualified domain name.
.SS \f[B][-d, --destination \f[I]destinationUrl\f[]]\f[]
.PP
Set the destination URL for the transfer.
.PP
Possible URL examples:
.IP \[bu] 2
[gsi]ftp://FQDN[:PORT]/path/to/file
.IP \[bu] 2
[file://]/path/to/file
.PP
\[lq]FQDN\[rq] is the fully qualified domain name.
.SS \f[B][-f, --transfer-list \f[I]transferList\f[]]\f[]
.PP
As alternative to providing source and destination URLs on the
command line, one can also provide a list of source and destination
URLs in a transfer list; \f[B]gtransfer\f[] will then perform a
\f[I]list transfer\f[] instead of an \f[I]URL transfer\f[] when
using source and destination URLs.
.PP
The format of each line of the transfer list file is as follows
(including the double quotes!):
.PP
\[lq]<PROTOCOL>://<FQDN1>:<PORT>/path/to/file\[rq]
\[lq]<PROTOCOL>://<FQDN2>:<PORT>/path/to/file[s/]\[rq]
.PP
Throughout all lines the source URL host part (e.g.
\[lq]<PROTOCOL>://<FQDN1>:<PORT>\[rq]) has to be identical.
This is also required for the destination URL host part.
.SS \f[B][-o, --auto-optimize \f[I]transferMode\f[]]\f[]
.PP
This option activates an automatic optimization of transfers
depending on the size of files to be transferred.
If less than 100 files are going to be transferred, gtransfer will
fall back to URL or list transfer depending on command line
options.
The \f[I]transferMode\f[] controls how files of different size
classes are transferred.
Currently \[lq]seq[uential]\[rq] (different size classes are
transferred sequentially) is possible.
To define different file size classes use the file
\f[I][\&...]/chunkConfig\f[].
See \f[B]FILES\f[] section below for more details.
.SS \f[B][--guc-max-retries \f[I]gucMaxRetries\f[]]\f[]
.PP
This option sets the maximum number of retries globus-url-copy
(guc) will do for a transfer of a single file.
By default this is set to 1, which means that guc will tolerate at
max.
one transfer error per file and retry the transfer once.
Alternatively this option can also be set through the environment
variable \f[B]GUC_MAX_RETRIES\f[].
.SS \f[B][--gt-max-retries \f[I]gtMaxRetries\f[]]\f[]
.PP
This option sets the maximum number of retries gt will do for a
single transfer step.
By default this is set to 3, which means that gt will try to finish
a single transfer step three times or fail.
Alternatively this option can also be set through the environment
variable \f[B]GT_MAX_RETRIES\f[].
.SS \f[B][-v, --verbose]\f[]
.PP
Be verbose.
.SS \f[B][-m, --metric \f[I]dataPathMetric\f[]]\f[]
.PP
Set the metric to select the corresponding path of a data path.
.SS \f[B][-l, --logfile \f[I]logfile\f[]]\f[]
.PP
Set the name for the logfile, tgftp will generate for each
transfer.
If specified with \[lq]\&.log\[rq] as extension, gtransfer will
insert a \[lq]__step_#\[rq] string to the name of the logfile
(\[lq]#\[rq] is the number of the transfer step performed).
If omitted gtransfer will automatically generate a name for the
logfile(s).
.SS \f[B][-a, --auto-clean]\f[]
.PP
Remove logfiles automatically after the transfer completed.
.SS \f[B][--configfile \f[I]configurationFile\f[]]\f[]
.PP
Set the name of the configuration file for gtransfer.
If not set, this defaults to:
.IP "1." 3
\[lq]/etc/gtransfer/gtransfer.conf\[rq] or
.IP "2." 3
\[lq]<GTRANSFER_BASE_PATH>/etc/gtransfer.conf\[rq] or
.IP "3." 3
\[lq]/etc/opt/gtransfer/gtransfer.conf\[rq] or
.IP "4." 3
\[lq]$HOME/.gtransfer/gtransfer.conf\[rq] in this order.
.SS \f[B][-- \f[I]gucParameters\f[]]\f[]
.PP
Set the \f[B]globus-url-copy(1)\f[] parameters that should be used
for all transfer steps.
Notice the space between \[lq]--\[rq] and the actual parameters.
This overwrites any available default parameters and is not
recommended for regular usage.
There exists one exception for the \f[B]-len|-partial-length\ X\f[]
option.
If this is provided, it will only be added to the transfer
parameters from a dparam for a connection or - if no dparam is
available - to the builtin default transfer parameters.
.PP
\f[B]NOTICE:\f[] If specified, this option must be the last one in
a \f[B]gtransfer\f[] command line.
.PP
General options:
.SS \f[B][--help]\f[]
.PP
Prints out a help message.
.SS \f[B][-V, --version]\f[]
.PP
Prints out version information.
.SH FILES
.SS \f[I][\&...]/gtransfer.conf\f[]
.PP
The \f[B]gtransfer\f[] configuration file.
.SS \f[I][\&...]/chunkConfig\f[]
.PP
The chunk configuration file.
In this file you can define the different file size classes for the
auto-optimization.
Practically the file is a table with three columns:
\f[B]MIN_SIZE_IN_MB\f[], \f[B]MAX_SIZE_IN_MB\f[] and
\f[B]GUC_PARAMETERS\f[] separated by a semicolon.
.PP
Each line defines a size class.
The value for \f[B]MIN_SIZE_IN_MB\f[] is not included in the class.
The value for \f[B]MAX_SIZE_IN_MB\f[] is included in the class.
Use the keyword \[lq]min\[rq] in the column \f[B]MIN_SIZE_IN_MB\f[]
to default to the size of the smallest file available in a transfer
list.
Files of this size will be included in this class then.
Use the keyword \[lq]max\[rq] in the column \f[B]MAX_SIZE_IN_MB\f[]
to default to the size of the biggest file available in a transfer
list.
The third column \f[B]GUC_PARAMETERS\f[] defines the transfer
parameters to use for the specific file size class.
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ \ MIN_SIZE_IN_MB;MAX_SIZE_IN_MB;GUC_PARAMETERS
      min;50;-cc\ 16\ -tcp-bs\ 4M\ -stripe\ -sbs\ 4M\ -cd
      50;250;-cc\ 8\ -tcp-bs\ 8M\ -stripe\ -sbs\ 4M\ -cd
      250;max;-cc\ 6\ -p\ 4\ -tcp-bs\ 8M\ -stripe\ -sbs\ 8M\ -g2\ -cd
